title: Guidelines for Selecting ICSME Key Personnel and Conference Location
date: 1999-09-16
last-revised: 2015-10-01

<p style="text-align: justify"><i>Purpose</i>: Minimize the probability that a poor combination of PC personnel and conference location leads to disastrous results for both ICSME attendees and the reputation of ICSME. We must strike a balance between openness and competence (not necessarily mutually exclusive).<br/><br/>

<i>Procedure</i>: The SC will actively solicit proposals for organizing ICSME. A proposal will be submitted by the proposed General Chair. Proposals for a given year, X, will be accepted between three months and three days prior to ICSME X-2. For example, proposals for ICSME 2020 will be accepted between three months and three days prior to ICSME 2018. If needed, the SC will invite the proposed General Chair to an interview via teleconference or at ICSME, or solicit additional information via e-mail. Final decision will be made at the first SC meeting after the election at ICSME X-2. The people who submitted proposals will be notified immediately. The SC will appoint the Program Chairs, in consultation with the General Chair. The other positions on the organizing committee will be selected by the General Chair and submitted for approval to the SC.</p>
