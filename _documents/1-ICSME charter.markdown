        <li>Have served for the current or previous ICSM(E) in any of the following roles: (i) Program Committee member of the main track; (ii) Program (Co-)Chair of the main track; (iii) General (Co-)Chair. </li>
        <li>Subscribe to the SC code of ethics.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<hr/>
<br/>

<li>
    <b>4. Code of Ethics.</b> Each SC member shall follow these principles in SC matters:
    <ul>
        <li><i>Openness</i>. Willing to receive input from anyone.</li>
        <li><i>Response to inquiries</i>. Will swiftly acknowledge inquiries and track them to their completion.</li>
        <li><i>Non-ownership</i>. Realize that SC members are not owners of ICSME, but caretakers of it for a limited time. ICSME decisions will be made in the best interests of ICSME, and not necessarily (i) to further the SC member's continuance as an SC member, or (ii) in the best interests of another conference or organization.</li>
        <li><i>Courteous</i>. Be courteous with other SC members and with those approaching them with SC matters.</li>
        <li><i>Participation</i>. Take SC duties seriously and perform them professionally. Take an active interest in SC matters and actively contribute inputs when requested. Respond to requests in a reasonable time. Agree to abide by the SC Charter. Attend all ICSME and the SC meetings during their term.</li>
        <li><i>Disclosure of conflict of interest</i>. When a matter arises before the SC that an SC member is a direct party to, or stands to personally gain or lose from, that member shall disclose that there is a conflict of interest and disqualify himself or herself from taking part in considerations of the matter.</li>
        <li><i>Truthful and honest, in all SC dealings</i>. </li>
        <li><i>Confidentiality</i>. On sensitive matters SC members will not disclose SC discussions unless authorized by the SC to do so. Will hold confidences when requested.</li>
        <li><i>Commitment to ICSME</i>. Believe in the worth of ICSME and will support its future.</li>
        <li><i>Support of IEEE CS</i>. Will be subject to rules and regulations of the IEEE Computer Society, as long as IEEE CS is a primary sponsor of ICSME.</li>
        <li><i>No bribes</i>. No SC member may receive any reward, payment, or other consideration in return for his or her voting in a particular manner on some issue.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<hr/>
<br/>

<li>
    <b>5. Membership Terms.</b> Each member of the SC is normally elected for a term of three years. Every year, two seats of the SC will be available for election. Terms begin on the day of election (held during ICSME) and end three years later on election day. No person may serve consecutively more than two terms.
</li>

<hr/>
<br/>

<li>
    <b>6. Elections.</b>  Notification of election of Steering Committee members shall be made at each ICSME. During an open steering committee meeting all attendees of the current edition of ICSME can propose SC candidates. If another attendee seconds this candidacy, the candidate is requested to confirm his candidacy. All candidates get the opportunity to introduce themselves to the ICSME community and express their thoughts and ideas for improving ICSME to the general audience. After this, each attendee gets a voting ballot on which (s)he can note two candidates for the SC election. <br/><br/>
    
    If qualifications of the proposed candidate could not have been verified during the elections procedure and the elected candidate does not meet the qualifications stated in Section 3 of this document, the elected candidate will be replaced by the proposed candidate that received less votes but meets those qualifications. If no candidate meets those qualifications or less than two candidates have been nominated Section 7 applies. <br/><br/>

    <i>Election of SC Chair</i>. The SC Chair has a one-year term starting from the end of the committee meeting at which he or she is elected until the end of the corresponding meeting one year (approximately) later. The SC Chair shall be elected by the committee immediately following the open meeting at which new SC members are elected. The previous SC will designate a retiring SC member to co-ordinate the election of the SC chair. The SC Chair is elected by majority vote from the current SC. The IEEE Computer Society conference office will be told about the new SC Chair by that new Chair.
</li>

<hr/>
<br/>

<li>
    <b>7. Replacements.</b> Replacements of resigning or removed members are made by selection and vote of the SC, on or before one month after the resignation or removal is effective. The term of the replacing member is the same as the term of the replaced SC member. The SC Chair may be replaced by another SC member by vote of the SC. Replacement here means that the SC member is no longer SC Chair, not that the SC member is no longer a member of the SC.   
</li>

<hr/>
<br/>

<li>
    <b>8. Removal.</b> A person may be removed from the SC for gross or consistent violations of the code of ethics, or for other reasons deemed conduct unbecoming by the SC. Removal is by vote of the SC, and is effective at the conclusion of the vote. Removed members must wait at least one full term (i.e., at least three years) before being considered again for SC membership.<br/><br/>

    SC members are expected to attend all ICSME and the SC meetings during their term. If a SC member misses a conferences held during their term, without serious reason, they may be removed from the SC by the vote of the other SC members.<br/><br/>

    If such a situation arises, the removed SC member will be notified by the SC Chair or Secretary.   
</li>

<hr/>
<br/>

<li>
    <b>9. Motions, Resolutions.</b> Only the committee may collectively agree on policies, motions, and resolutions of the SC. There must be at least four votes cast on a resolution/motion for a vote's result to be binding. At least four votes are necessary to carry an item.<br/><br/>

    All members must be allowed the opportunity to vote on changes in membership (including removal or replacement of a member) or changes to the Charter. An urgent motion is an item requested by an SC member for a quick SC vote. All SC members will be notified of the item and a vote will be made on the item within one month from when the item is received by the SC Chair.<br/><br/>

    <i>In absentia voting</i>. In absentia voting in writing by SC members by electronic mail is allowed. The voting SC member's identity must be verified.
</li>
<hr/>
<br/>

<li>
    <b>10. Communications.</b> Most issues and votes will be handled through electronic mail. Each SC member must have an electronic mail address. The SC charter, motions, and resolutions made since the last ICSME shall be made publicly available at each ICSME. Apart from ICSME, people may request these from the SC archives.

    <b>11. Language.</b> The official language of the SC will be English.

Program chairs of additional tracks (e.g., ERA, Industry, Tool) as well as their students shall not submit papers to their tracks.<br/><br/>

    Futhermore: 
    <ul>
        <li>ICSME should be a selective conference i.e., all papers which are deemed to be of sufficiently high standard are accepted, i.e., on merit; there is no fixed proportion of the submission number to be accepted (maximum or minimum).</li>
