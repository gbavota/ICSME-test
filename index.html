<p style="text-align: justify;">Since its start in 1983, ICSM (International Conference on Software Maintenance) has grown and developed into an international forum for software maintenance researchers and practitioners to examine key issues facing the software maintenance community. Participants from academia, government, and industry share ideas and experiences solving critical software maintenance problems.  Reflecting the importance of evolutionary challenges in software maintenance, starting from 2014 ICSM became known as as the International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME).

  ICSME is the premier international (world wide) event in the maintenance field. The importance of software maintenance is being increasingly recognised, both in terms of professional activities and of public perception. Hence it is vital for the community of researchers and practitioners to publish, present, and debate the latest results in the field. The ICSME proceedings present works of outstanding international excellence, where reports on the latest advances in the field may be found.</p>
